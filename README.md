# üëã Hi, I'm Naga Sai Dhanya Veerepalli

As a data analytics professional with a strong foundation in **Python, R, SQL, and cloud-based big data tools**, I specialize in uncovering actionable insights through scalable pipelines, machine learning models, and impactful visualizations. My work spans across domains like infrastructure resiliency, electric vehicle trends, and log intelligence using LLMs. With hands-on experience in tools like **PySpark, AWS, Power BI, and TensorFlow**, I‚Äôm passionate about building data-driven solutions that are both technically sound and business-focused.

## üß† About Me

Beyond my professional projects, my daily hobby is diving into all kinds of datasets just for fun ‚Äî from weirdly specific CSVs to massive public repositories. Whether it‚Äôs decoding EV adoption trends or predicting bizarre internet traffic spikes, I enjoy turning raw data into stories, insights, and occasionally, colorful dashboards.

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) Outage Analysis  
Analyzed the impact of DNSSEC outages during natural disasters by combining DNS server availability logs with disaster event data (e.g., earthquakes, tsunamis) specific to Indonesia, revealing patterns of vulnerability in critical infrastructure.  
Built a scalable data pipeline using AWS S3 for storage, AWS EMR for data extraction and transformation with PySpark/SparkSQL, and developed machine learning models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting) to predict server outages under adverse conditions.  
Visualized outage trends and disaster correlations using Power BI and AWS QuickSight, supported by geospatial mapping and temporal insights to highlight high-risk regions and improve DNS resiliency planning.

### 2. Electric Vehicle Population Analysis using R  
Conducted a detailed analysis of U.S. Electric Vehicle (EV) population data from Data.gov using R, focusing on trends in electric range, vehicle type (BEV/PHEV), and policy eligibility (CAFV).  
Applied exploratory data analysis, multiple regression, and regression tree models to identify patterns in EV range, price, and adoption.  
Performed k-means clustering to group EVs by range and model year, identifying Washington state as a key region for high-range EV adoption.

### 3. Logs Classification using BERT and LLM  
Built a Python-based log classification system using BERT embeddings (SentenceTransformer) and Large Language Models (LLMs), supporting multiple log formats and extensible classification categories.  
Implemented machine learning pipelines with Scikit-learn, automated classification using joblib, and integrated GROQ LLM APIs to offer dual-mode predictions, improving classification accuracy and scalability.
